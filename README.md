# Prework Study Guide Webpage for Ben Young

## Description

This is a website I created to store notes on what I learned in my bootcamp's prework modules, specifically those relating to HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git. I hope to continually update it as the course goes on, so that I have a reliable place to refresh my memory should the need arise. 

## Installation

## Usage

Each section includes notes on the topic specified. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the Javascript runnning; its function is to list topics I learned about over the course of prework and recommend topics for study.
